Why we should exclude packages and class from compiling:
    In IntelliJ if we have a syntax error in any of the file in a project we can't run
    another file unless and until we fix that error.
    Sometimes we want to execute code in some files without fixing those issues. This is where we should
    exclude
How to Exclude packages:
    Double-click the shift button twice quickly and type excludes and hit enter from the pop-up window
    click on the plus button and select the packages that you want to exclude.
How Java code is executed on a computer.
    We write the code in files with extension .java
    Once we hit the run button a software program called compiler checks this code for errors and convert
    it to the byte code. Usually stored in a folder called bin/out.
    JVM another software converts this code to binary code and this binary code is what is excluded
    on your computers.
Methods in Java:
    Methods is a block of code or some Java statements (any Java code which ends with semicolons) grouped
    together.
Why we should learn about the methods:
    Methods help us reduce the amount of code that we have to write. For example if a piece of code
    is being repeated. We can create a method for it and simple call that method whenever
    we need that logic again.
Syntax of creating a method:
    We can create methods only inside a class.
    [datatype] [method name] [(datatype variableName)] [method body]
    [datatype] can be void boolean String int etc.
    [method name] They are like variable names.
    [(datatype variableName)] used to pass data while calling a method.
How do we decide that we should use void or a method with a return keyword.
    If we are building a method that will be used by others or in other parts of your code which
    require some data from your method like an if condition we should not create methods with void
    type.
