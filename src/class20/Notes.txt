What is inheritance:
    It's a mechanism through which a class can inherit the properties and methods of another class.
Why we should learn inheritance?
    It helps us avoid code duplication.
    It helps us save space.
    It helps us improve the execution speed.
Syntax for inheritance:
    We use the <extends> keyword and the name of the class from which we want to inherit the fields
    and methods, in the class declaration statement.
Types of inheritance:
    There are 4 types of inheritance, but Java only supports 3 of them.
    1) Single inheritance.
    2) Multilevel inheritance.
    3) Hierarchical inheritance.
    4) Multiple inheritance (doesn't supported by Java).

Single inheritance:
    When we have only one parent and only one child class. Not widely used in programming.
Multilevel inheritance:
    1 - Vehicle
    2 - Car
    3 - Ford
    One top level and one base class and many intermediate classes. For example A<B<C<d.
Hierarchical inheritance:
    One parent class and multiple child classes.
    1 - Car (parent class)
    2 - Ford, Tesla, Toyota  (child classes)
Multiple inheritance:
    One child with multiple parent classes. It doesn't support by classes in Java because of the possible
    "Diamond" problem (when parent class have the same name variables or methods, and child class doesn't
    know which variable or method to use).
Super keyword:
    We use the "super" keyword to explicitly call the variable from the parent class. When we have the same name
    instance variable in child class and parent class.
    We can also use the super keyword to call the constructor of the parent class.

Method Overloading:
    Method overloading allows us to create multiple methods in a class with the same name.
Why we should create multiple methods with the same name?
    It gives the end user flexibility.
    The end user can call the same method with different parameters to get same or different result.
How do we overload a method?
    1) By passing different number of parameters.
    2) By changing the datatype.
    3) By changing the sequence(order) of parameters
