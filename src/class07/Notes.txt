Java Class 7

Switch case: is a statament which execute only one statement from the list of statements. It makes code cleaner.

Switch syntax:

    switch(variable) {
        case value1:
                code A;
                break;
        case value2:
                code B;
                break;
        default:
                code C;
                break;
    }

Limitations of Switch statment:
    - data type: CANNOT work with double, float, long, boolean data types.
    - operators: CANNOT work with logical and realtional operators.
