    - of calculateSalePrice() method in which returned price is calculated as following: if weight>2000 then
    - returned price car should include 10% discount, otherwise 20% discount.
    - The Sedan class has field as length and also does it is own implementation of calculateSalePrice():
    - if length of sedan is >20 feet then returned car price should include 5% discount, otherwise 10% discount
