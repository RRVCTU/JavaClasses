"this" keyword:
    "this" is a keyword like "class", "void". It is used in many places. For example if we have same name
    instance and a local variable we can use "this" to explicitly refer to instance variable.
    We can use "this()" to call a constructor inside another constructor.
Why should we learn about "this" keyword:
    1) It allows us to have the same name for local and instance variables.
    2) If we have the same code in two constructors, we can reuse the code from one constructor inside
    another constructor by writing "this()".
Inheritance:
    Inheritance is a mechanism in Java through which we can use the fields/methods of one class inside
    another class.
    There are 4 types of inheritance (Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical, and Multiple), but Java use only 3 of
    them (Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical).
    1) Single inheritance: Only one parent and only one child class.
    Employee -> Person
    2) Multilevel inheritance: This about building with flor (levels). In multilevel inheritance we have
    inheritance in mulitple levels like:
    1 level: Grandparent
    2 level: Father
    3 level: Son
    4 level: Grandson
    3) Hierarchical inheritance: One parent class and multiple direct child classes.
    4) Multiple inheritance: Once child class can directly inherit from multiple parent classes
       (diamond problem). But multiple inheritance does not supported by Java.
Why should we learn concept of inheritance?
    It allows us to reduce the duplicate code in out program.
What is the syntax?
    We can use inheritance by writing "extends" keyword when declaring any child class.
