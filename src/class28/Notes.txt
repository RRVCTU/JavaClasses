Maps in Java:
    Maps are datastructures that allow us to store key-value pairs.
Why we use Maps?
    Whenever we have to store key-value pairs instead of using arrays or 2D array or ArrayList, we should use Maps,
    because they provide very good performance and have build-in methods to process the data.
What is the syntax of Maps?
    Map<DataTypeOfKey, DataTypeOfValue> anyName = new Map<>();
    e.g.: if we have to store fruits and their prices, we will do next:
    HashMap<String, Double> fruit = new HashMap<>();
Types of Maps:
    1) HashMap
    2) LinkedHashMap
    3) TreeMap

HashMap:
    This is the most widely used type of map. It is fasterst and occupy less memory.
    We should always use HashMap, if there are no requirements for insertion order or sorting.
LinkedHashMap:
    LinkedHasMap keeps the insertion order, but it takes a little more memory than HashMap and is a little slower.
TreeMap:
    TreeMap sorts the data in natural order but insertion is very slow. It takes more memory to keep the data in sorted
    order.

FileHandling:
    Reading, writing data to files with the help of java is called file handling.
Steps to read data from any files on any computer:
    1) Location of file on our computer.
    2) We need to go to that location.
    3) We need a software that can read and write data to that file.
       e.g.: we need MS Excel if we want to work with .xlsx files.
