Collections Framework:
    Collection framework is collection of multiple classes and interfaces
    which help us process the data efficiently and easily.
Why we should learn about it.
    1) Its very flexible.
    2) Provide ready-made methods that we can just use.
What is the Syntax?
    Its similar how we create the object of any class, but we use <> to specify the name
    of the class whose objects we are going to store in that class.
Issues with Collections framework:
    1) Collection framework does not work with primitive datatypes (solution is to use wrapper classes).

Note: frequently asked in interviews!!!!!!!

Wrapper classes:
    Wrapper classes are the envelopes for primitive data.
    Wrapper classes are object types for all primitive types.
    Boxing -> convert from primitive data type to wrapper class.
    Unboxing -> convert from wrapper class to primitive data type.

Boxing:
    converting the primitive data type to its corresponding wrapper type by explicitly calling methods.

Auto Boxing:
    converting the primitive data type to its corresponding wrapper type by simply assigning the values.
    Integer wrappedNum=10;
Unboxing:
    Converting a wrapper type to its corresponding primtive type by explicitly calling a method.
      // unboxing converting a wrapper type to a corresponding primitive type
      // int num2=wrappedNum.intValue();
Auto Unboxing:
    converting a wrapper to corresponding primitive automatically by just assigning the value.
    Integer wrappedNum=new Integer(10);
    int num2=wrappedNum;
