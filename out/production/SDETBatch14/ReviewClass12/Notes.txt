Collections framework:
    is a set of classes and interfaces that help us store and manipulate data.
Why we need collections framework?
    1) Flexibility.
    2) Ready-made methods.
    3) Same classes and methods can be used with different datatypes.
Some common classes:
    1) ArrayList
    2) LinkedList
    3) HashSet
    4) LinkedHashSet
    5) TreeSet
Some common interfaces:
    1) List
    2) Set
List:
    1) Lists like ArrayList and LinkedList maintains the insertion order.
    2) They allow duplicates.
Set:
    1) Set does not allow duplicate values.
ArrayList vs LinkedList:
    When most of the time we retrieve the data(get()) we should use ArrayList as it is very fast to retrieve index
    based data as underlying datastructures is an array.
    When most of the time we manipulate the data(adding, removing, shifting) add(), remove()
Note:
    if else condition
    loops
    arrays
    String class
    maps
    ArrayList

HashSet vs LinkedHashSet vs TreeSet:
    We should always go with the HashSet because it is faastest of all and requires less memory.
    If order is important like for example when we go to KFC the customers who order frist should be processed first
    we should use LinkedHashSet.
    If we are working on applications that requires us to sort data like phonebooks and dictionaryes, we should
    use TreeSet.
Maps:
    Whenever we have to store key-value pairs (for example: items and their prices, we should use Maps.
