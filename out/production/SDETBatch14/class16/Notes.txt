Types of variables in Java with respect to their scope:
    There are three types of variables in java with respect to their scope.
    Local, instance, and static variables.

Local variables:
    If a variable is declared inside a block of code like method, loop, if-condition
    they are called local variables.
Up-side of a local variable:
    The local variable exists for a very short amount of time in the memory.
    Which means other programs on our computer can use that memory.
Down-side of local variables:
    Their scope is very limited. Only inside that block in which they are created.
    We can't access them outside that block.
When to use:
    We should always try to use local variable over instance variables whenever it is possible.
Instance variables:
    They are inside the class but outside the method.
    The variables which are declared inside a class but outside of block of code are called
    instance variables.
Up-side of instance variables:
    We can use these variables inside any block of code that is inside that class.
Down-side of instance variables:
    Consume the memory for longest time. They occupy the memory for longer than a local variable.
When we should use instance variables:
    1) When we need to share a value between two or more methods than we should go with the instance variable.
    2) When we are planning to create multiple objects of a class and it is possible that all the objects
       can have a diffirent value for that variable.

Static variable:
    An instance variable with static keyword is called a static variable.
Up-side:
    We can share data across the objects with the help of static variable.
Down-side:
    They occupy the memory for the longest period.
When to use:
    When we want to share something across all the methods.

Access Modifiers:
    Access modifiers are keywords which control the access of fields or methods or the class itself.
    There are four access levels and three access modifier keywords. These are only applicable to
    instance or static variable not to local variables.

1) Private access modifier.
    Private is the most restricted one. If we use private keyword with any variable or method,
    we can only access it within the same class.
When we should use private access modifier.
    We should use it always when it is possible. We should always try to create variables as private.
    The data that we store inside the private variables is secured.
2) Default access modifier (doesn't need any keyword).
    Default is not a keyword. Whenever we don't assign any access modifier keyword like private or
    public, Java assigns default access level to those variables or method.
    The variables or methods which have default access level can be accessed within the whole package.
3) Public access modifier.
    Any class in the whole project can access this variable or method. Public access is the most
    unrestricted access modifier. Once used with a variable or a method we can access that variable
    or method anywhere in our project.
